# Timestamp Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the timestamp handling implementation across the CQRS microservices.

## What Was Already in Place

### Database Level
- All database schemas (`CategorySchema` and `ProductSchema`) in both command and query services already had `timestamps()` macro
- This creates `inserted_at` and `updated_at` columns with `NaiveDateTime` type

### Domain Level
- All domain entities/models already had `created_at` and `updated_at` fields defined as `DateTime | nil`
- Command service entities automatically set timestamps on creation and update
- Query service models have a `with_timestamps` method to add timestamp data

### Command Service Repositories
- Already had proper timestamp conversion from `NaiveDateTime` to `DateTime` using helper functions
- `schema_to_entity` function properly maps database timestamps to entity timestamps

## What Was Updated

### Query Service Repositories (Fixed)

1. **CategoryRepository** (`/apps/query_service/lib/query_service/infrastructure/repositories/category_repository.ex`)
   - Added timestamp conversion helper functions
   - Updated `schema_to_model` to convert NaiveDateTime to DateTime before passing to `with_timestamps`

2. **ProductRepository** (`/apps/query_service/lib/query_service/infrastructure/repositories/product_repository.ex`)
   - Added timestamp conversion helper functions
   - Updated `schema_to_model` to convert NaiveDateTime to DateTime before passing to `with_timestamps`

## Timestamp Conversion Helper Functions

Added to both query service repositories:
```elixir
defp to_datetime(nil), do: nil
defp to_datetime(%NaiveDateTime{} = naive_dt), do: DateTime.from_naive!(naive_dt, "Etc/UTC")
defp to_datetime(%DateTime{} = dt), do: dt
```

## How It Works

1. **Database Storage**: Ecto stores timestamps as `NaiveDateTime` in PostgreSQL
2. **Conversion**: Repository layer converts `NaiveDateTime` to `DateTime` with UTC timezone
3. **Domain Layer**: All entities/models work with `DateTime` objects
4. **gRPC Layer**: Timestamps are converted to Google Protobuf Timestamp format when needed

## Testing

A test script (`test_timestamps.exs`) was created to verify:
- Categories and products save with proper timestamps
- Timestamps are correctly converted between NaiveDateTime and DateTime
- Updates properly change only the `updated_at` timestamp
- Query service correctly reads and displays timestamps
- Statistics functions properly count records with timestamps

## Current Status

✅ All repositories now properly handle timestamp conversions
✅ Consistent timestamp handling across command and query services
✅ No database migrations needed (timestamps already exist)
✅ All compilation warnings related to timestamps resolved
